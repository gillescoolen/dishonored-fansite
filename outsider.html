                    The Outsider is a mysterious supernatural being said to be part-devil, part-angel, neither good nor evil. He appears to Corvo Attano and Daud as a plain-looking young man with short brown hair and black eyes, wearing a brown coat, blue pants and black boots.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Born a human outcast over 4,000 years before the events of Dishonored, with no known family, at 15 years old the "powerless and abused" orphan was unwillingly subjected to a ritual by an occult group in which "he was bathed and dressed, and his hands were adorned with rings. He was thought to show all signs in him to become one with the Void, notably his age and bits of prophecy (the celestial movements and events like the mass dying of fish). He then "merged in part with the Void" to become a "being of insatiable curiosity about what people do when given power over others."As a "godlike entity" who represents the current time period, the Outsider appears to people he finds "interesting," and can make contact with them both through dreams, and in the physical world at his shrines.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The Outsider remains neutral in regard to events that transpire in the mortal world. He does not place conditions on those he gifts with supernatural abilities, and does not factor hierarchy or effort into their selection; Corvo, for instance, is granted the Mark without seeking it, while Anton Sokolov is never given an audience despite numerous summoning rituals and sacrifices.
