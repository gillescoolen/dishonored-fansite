                <h1> Corvo Attano </h1>
                <br/>
                    Corvo Attano was born into a lower class family in Karnaca on the 25th day of the Month of Nets in 1798. Corvo used to live happily, often wandering through the more rural parts of the city until his father, a lumber worker, was tragically killed in a workplace accident. He then grew up with his sister Beatrici, fighting in the streets, until she too disappeared.
                <br/><br/>
                    By the age of 16, Corvo won the Blade Verbena, an annual sword duel festival, which earned him an early officer ranking in the Grand Serkonan Guard. Eventually, after two years of service, Theodanis Abele, the Duke of Serkonos, became highly impressed by his skill, and on the 28th day of the Month of Rain, Corvo was sent to Dunwall to serve the Emperor Euhorn Kaldwin as a political gesture.
                <br/><br/>
                    A year later, Corvo was chosen to serve as Royal Protector to the Emperor's daughter, Jessamine Kaldwin, which in the process gave him a higher social status. He also became the first Royal Protector to be born outside of Gristol.
                <br/><br/>
                    Corvo and Jessamine secretly became lovers in 1823. However, their lasting closeness did not go unnoticed by Emily or the general public, and rumors to that effect circulated throughout Dunwall. While several people (including Lydia Brooklaine, Treavor Pendleton, and Anton Sokolov) mention the affair to Corvo, it is never publicly acknowledged. Four years later, Emily was born from their relationship, though her paternal parentage is kept secret. Despite this situation, Corvo has a strong bond with his daughter and often publicly interacts with her in a familiar and affectionate manner. Emily's behavior toward Corvo suggests that she sees him as a father figure, and she often asks to be taught by him.
