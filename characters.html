                    <h2>Emily Kaldwin</h2>
                    Emily Kaldwin is the rightful heir to the throne of the Isles and Empress Jessamine Kaldwin's only child. Emily was kidnapped following her mother's murder by the assassin Daud, for which Royal Protector Corvo Attano was framed. The Loyalist Conspiracy sought to recover Emily and reinstate the royal line by seeing her crowned Empress.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Emily was reinstated as Empress of the Isles. For fourteen years, her reign saw the reorganization of the Dunwall City Watch, increased trade between the Isles, and the development of Dunwall proper. On 18th Day, Month of Earth, 1852, Emily Kaldwin was deposed of her throne in a coup led by Delilah Copperspoon with the complicity of Luca Abele, Duke of Serkonos.

                    <h2>Jessamine Kaldwin</h2>
                    Jessamine Kaldwin I is the late Empress of the Empire of the Isles, who is killed by the assassin Daud on the orders of the Royal Spymaster Hiram Burrows. Before her death, Jessamine watches helplessly as her daughter, Emily Kaldwin, is kidnapped by Daud's assassins. As she passes, she charges Corvo Attano with the safe return and protection of her beloved child. Her body and circumstance are later used to charge Corvo with treason, kidnapping, and murder.

                    <h2>Vera 'Granny Rags' Moray</h2>
                    Vera Moray, also known as Granny Rags, was a wealthy aristocrat living in the high reaches of society who, after an ill-fated expedition to the Pandyssian Continent, became a practitioner of black magic and descended into madness. During the events of Dishonored, she is a homeless and blind old woman who is often harassed by her fellow citizens, specifically members of the Bottle Street Gang. While she appears on the surface to be vulnerable, destitute, and senile, her true and darker nature lies underneath. After going on a trip with her husband, she began practising black magic. Vera's circumstances spiraled into misfortuneâ€”she lost her status in high society and began living on the streets. She officially became Granny Rags in 1815. According to Slackjaw, when he was a young child, Vera was already well known as Granny Rags.
